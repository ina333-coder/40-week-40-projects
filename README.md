# Study Timer (Pomodoro)
Description

This is a simple Python project that helps users focus on studying using a countdown timer.
It asks for a study topic, runs a timer, and then suggests a random break activity.

What the project does

The project is the ensure that the children or people of any age who faces difficulty to study due to distraction can get back to study with this program. it uses a simple pomodoro technique to study which is 25 min study and 5 min break. Often people who tries pomodoro technique doesn't know what to do in this 5 min break and end up scrolling phone for many hours instead of 5 min, for such people we offer simple task to do during that 5 min.which helps to make that study period effectively.



✅ Concepts used

User Input → input() to take topic from user

Input Validation → while loop to prevent empty input

String Method → .strip() to remove extra spaces

Lists → storing break activities in a list

**Loops**

while loop for validation

for loop for countdown

Range Function → range(start, stop, step) for countdown

Time Control → time.sleep() for delay



Randomization → random.choice() to select a break task

✅ What you learned

I learnt many concept that I didn't know before like random,strip(),sleep time,for while etc

✅ What you want to improve next

my program mainly focuses on pomodoro but I also want to make it like the convenient time for user and adjust time according to that  like for every 25 min 5 min break that means if a person study for 12min break(for each 5min study 1 min break).
